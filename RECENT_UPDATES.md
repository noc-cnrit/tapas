# Recent Updates Summary - January 30, 2025

## 🚀 Major Changes Completed

### ⭐ Chef's Specials Enhancement
- **Problem**: Chef's Specials weren't shown when "all" menus were loaded initially
- **Solution**: Modified both server-side (`index.php`) and API (`get_menu_data.php`) to always include Chef's Specials at the top when "all" filter is requested
- **Visual Enhancement**: Added distinctive gold/orange styling with "Featured" badge
- **Result**: Chef's Specials now prominently displayed on page load and when filtering

### 🔒 Import Functionality Removal (Security)
- **Problem**: CSV import feature posed risk of catastrophic data loss in production
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed "Import Data" card from admin dashboard
  - Disabled import script by renaming `admin/import.php` to `admin/import.php.disabled`
- **Result**: Production environment is now safe from accidental bulk data operations
