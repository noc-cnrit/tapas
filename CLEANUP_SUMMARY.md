## 🎉 **Final Result**

The **Plate St. Pete tapas website** now has:

- 🔧 **Better maintainability** with simplified structure  
- 🌐 **Full Siteground compatibility** without WordPress conflicts
- 📱 **Enhanced user experience** with direct menu access
- 🧹 **Cleaner codebase** with 1,700+ unnecessary files removed

## 🔄 **WordPress Image Management**
The WordPress installation remains fully functional in the `/wp/` subdirectory for:
- 📸 **Image uploads and optimization**
- 🖼️ **Image resizing and compression**

However, if the WordPress complexity becomes problematic, we can implement native PHP image handling with optimization libraries in the future.
